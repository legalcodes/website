title: Building a web application with Flutter
description: Instructions for creating a Flutter app for the web.
---

This page covers the following steps for getting started with web support:
- Configure the `flutter` tool for web support.
- Create a new project with web support.
- Run a new project with web support.
- Build an app with web support.
- Add web support to an existing project.

## Requirements
- [Install the Flutter SDK on your platform][Install Flutter].
- [Install Chrome]. Currently, debugging a web app requires the Chrome browser.

For more information, see the [web FAQ][].

{{ site.alert.note }}
  As of 1.12, Flutter has early support for running web applications, but
  you need to be running the `beta` channel of Flutter at present.
  If you experience a problem that hasn’t yet been reported,
  please [file an issue][] and make sure that “web” appears in the title.

## Create a new project with web support

You can use the following steps
to create a new project with web support.

### Set up
Run the following commands to use the latest version of the Flutter SDK
from the beta channel and enable web support:

```terminal
$ flutter channel beta
$ flutter upgrade
$ flutter config --enable-web
```

{{site.alert.note}}
The `flutter upgrade` command silently fails
when `origin` points to a personal fork.
To validate that `origin` points to `{{site.repo.flutter}}.git`,
run the following commands in the root directory
of your local copy of the `{{site.repo.flutter}}` repository:

```
$ cd <inside local copy of the flutter/flutter repo>
$ git remote get-url origin
https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
```
{{site.alert.end}}
Once web is enabled,
the `flutter devices` command outputs a `Chrome` device that opens the
Chrome browser with your app running, and a `Web Server` that provides the URL
serving the app.

```terminal
$ flutter devices
2 connected device:

Chrome     • chrome     • web-javascript • Google Chrome 78.0.3904.108
Web Server • web-server • web-javascript • Flutter Tools
```

**After enabling web support, restart your IDE.**
You should now see **Chrome (web)** in the device pulldown.

{{site.alert.note}}
You should only need to execute these configure steps once. You can always
check the status of your configuration using the `flutter config` command.
{{site.alert.end}}

### Create and run

To create a new app for use with web support
(in addition to mobile support), run the following commands,
substituting `myapp` with the name of your project:

```terminal
$ flutter create myapp
$ cd myapp
```

To serve your app from `localhost` in Chrome,
enter the following from the top of the package:

```terminal
$ flutter run -d chrome
```
{{site.alert.note}}
If there aren't any other connected devices,
the `-d chrome` is optional.
{{site.alert.end}}

The `flutter run` command launches the application using the
[development compiler][] in a Chrome browser.

### Build

Run the following command to generate a release build:

```terminal
$ flutter build web
```

A release build uses [dart2js][] (instead of the [development compiler][])
to produce a single JavaScript file `main.dart.js`.
You can create a release build using release mode (`flutter run --release`)
or by using `flutter build web`. This populates a `build/web` directory
with built files, including an `assets` directory,
which need to be served together.

### Add web support to an existing app

To add web support to an existing project,
run the following command in a
terminal from the root project directory:

```terminal
$ flutter create .
```
To serve your app from `localhost` in Chrome,
enter the following from the top of the package:

```terminal
$ flutter run -d chrome
```
