The beginning of a Flutter experience requires a brief wait while Dart
initializes. Additionally, a full Flutter app requires standard Android app
initialization time. Flutter supports the display of a launch screen
while your Android app initializes, and also supports the display of a splash
screen while your Flutter experience initializes. This guide teaches you how to
use launch screens and splash screens in an Android app with Flutter.

  initialization. Consider [pre-warming a FlutterEngine]() and
  [re-using a FlutterEngine throughout your app]() to avoid most wait time.

## Android launch screen

Every Android app requires initialization time while the operating system sets
up the app's process. Android provides the concept of a [launch screen] to
display a `Drawable` while the app is initializing.

Flutter provides support for displaying an Android launch screen before showing
a `FlutterActivity`. The instructions to display an Android launch screen are discussed in the next sections.

### Define a launch theme

In `styles.xml`, define a theme whose `windowBackground` is set to the
`Drawable` that should be displayed as the launch screen.

```xml
<style name="LaunchTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Black.NoTitleBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/launch_background</item>
</style>
```

{{site.alert.note}}
  The default Flutter project template includes a definition of a launch theme
  and a launch background.
{{site.alert.end}}

### Define a normal theme

In `styles.xml`, define a normal theme to be applied to `FlutterActivity` after
the launch screen is gone. The normal theme background only shows for a very
brief moment after the splash screen disappears, and during orientation change
and `Activity` restoration. Therefore, it's recommended that the normal theme
use a solid background color that looks similar to the primary background color
of the Flutter UI.

```xml
<style name="NormalTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Black.NoTitleBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/normal_background</item>
</style>
```

### Setup FlutterActivity in AndroidManifest.xml

In `AndroidManifest.xml`, set the `theme` of `FlutterActivity` to the launch
theme. Then, add a metadata element to the desired `FlutterActivity` to instruct
Flutter to switch from the launch theme to the normal theme at the appropriate time.

```xml
<activity
    android:name=".MyActivity"
    android:theme="@style/LaunchTheme"
    // ...
    >
    <meta-data
        android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.NormalTheme"
        android:resource="@style/NormalTheme"
        />
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

The Android app now displays the desired launch screen while the app
initializes.

## Flutter splash screen

Each Flutter experience in an app requires a few moments to initialize the Dart
isolate that runs the code. This means a user momentarily sees a blank screen
until Flutter renders its first frame. Flutter supports an improved user
experience by displaying an Android `View` as a splash screen while Flutter
initializes.

Flutter supports two options for a splash screen. The first option is to  
display a `Drawable` of your choice, which fades out after the initialization
is complete. The other option is to provide a custom `SplashScreen`, which is
capable of displaying any Android `View` content that you want.

### Showing a Drawable splash screen

A `Drawable` splash screen can be configured for a `FlutterActivity`,
`FlutterFragment`, or `FlutterView`.

#### In a FlutterActivity

To display a `Drawable` as a Flutter splash screen in a `FlutterActivity`, add
the following metadata to the associated `FlutterActivity` in
`AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<meta-data
    android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.SplashScreenDrawable"
    android:resource="@drawable/my_splash"
    />
```

To display a splash screen with the same visual as a launch screen,
reference the same `@drawable/launch_background` in the
`io.flutter.embedding.android.SplashScreenDrawable` `meta-data`.

#### In a FlutterFragment

To display a `Drawable` as a Flutter splash screen in a `FlutterFragment`,
make `FlutterFragment` a subclass and override `provideSplashScreen()`.

```java
public class MyFlutterFragment extends FlutterFragment {
    @Override
    protected SplashScreen provideSplashScreen() {
        // Load the splash Drawable.
        Drawable splash = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.my_splash);

        // Construct a DrawableSplashScreen with the loaded splash Drawable and
        // return it.
        return new DrawableSplashScreen(splash);
    }
}
```

### Creating a custom SplashScreen

Splash screens are a great branding opportunity. Because of that, many teams 
implement unique, highly customized splash experiences. To facilitate this,
Flutter allows you to display an arbitrary Android `View` as a splash
screen, and even allows you to control how that `View` transitions to
Flutter after Flutter renders its first frame.

#### Implement a custom splash View

First, define the custom `View` that should be displayed as the splash screen.

This `View` could display anything, from a simple solid color to an animation. An example isn't provided because there are too many options.

#### Implement the SplashScreen interface

With a custom `View` defined, implement the `SplashScreen` interface.

This guide shows two approaches to a `SplashScreen` implementation. First, the following 
is an example of a `SplashScreen` that has no visual state and no transition
animation.

```java
public class SimpleSplashScreen implements SplashScreen {
    @Override
    @Nullable
    public View createSplashView(
      @NonNull Context context,
      @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState
    ) {
        // Return a new MySplashView without saving a reference, because it
        // has no state that needs to be tracked or controlled.
        return new MySplashView(context);
    }

    @Override
    public void transitionToFlutter(@NonNull Runnable onTransitionComplete) {
        // Immediately invoke onTransitionComplete because this SplashScreen
        // doesn't display a transition animation.
        //
        // Every SplashScreen *MUST* invoke onTransitionComplete at some point
        // for the splash system to work correctly.
        onTransitionComplete.run();
    }
}
```

The second example is a bit more sophisticated. In this example, the custom
`SplashScreen` keeps a reference to its custom `View` and instructs the custom
`View` to transition away, passing the `onTransitionComplete` callback to the
custom `View` to invoke.

```java
public class SplashScreenWithTransition implements SplashScreen {
    private MySplashView mySplashView;

    @Override
    @Nullable
    public View createSplashView(
      @NonNull Context context,
      @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState
    ) {
        // A reference to the MySplashView is retained so that it can be told
        // to transition away at the appropriate time.
        mySplashView = new MySplashView(context);
        return mySplashView;
    }

    @Override
    public void transitionToFlutter(@NonNull Runnable onTransitionComplete) {
        // Instruct MySplashView to animate away in whatever manner it wants.
        // The onTransitionComplete Runnable is passed to the MySplashView to be
        // invoked when the transition animation is complete.
        mySplashView.animateAway(onTransitionComplete);
    }
}
```

With custom splash screens, the sky is the limit. In fact, you could create a
splash screen that shows an animated sky! Have fun with this flexible splash
system, and share your creations with the community!
