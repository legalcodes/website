For a discussion of how to use Flutter's Navigator class with
various types of routes, see the
[API documentation on the Navigator class][].

The following [cookbook recipes cover {{page.title | downcase }}][cookbook]:

* [Navigate to a new screen and back][]
* [Navigate with named routes][]
* [Send data to a new screen][]
* [Pass arguments to a named route][]
* [Return data from a screen][]
* [Animating a widget across screens][]
